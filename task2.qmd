## Getting Started with Quarto Dashboard

- Please read through the tutorials for Quarto Dashboards https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/

## Examples of Quarto Dashboard using R coding

- [Dashboard Example 1](dashboard1.qmd), Labor and Delivery Dashboard
- [Dashboard Example 2](dashboard1.qmd), Palmer Penguins

## The Five Key Elements

Dr. Zhang will be happy if your dashboard clearly includes at least the
following five elements:

1.  A front page including a photo of you or of something relevant to
    you.
2.  Links to your social media presence, if any, and a way for people to
    get in touch with you via email.
3.  An About Me or Welcome section on your front page, which briefly
    describes what youâ€™re doing now.
4.  Some information on your Education, Experiences, and/or Projects
5.  A way to download your CV

A blog is also an appealing way to connect your thoughts with the world,
and including non-professional stuff is OK, too, of course.
