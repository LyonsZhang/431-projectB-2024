## Getting Started with Quarto Dashboard

- Please read through the tutorials for Quarto Dashboards [https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/)

## Examples of Quarto Dashboard using R coding

- [Dashboard Example 1](dashboard1.qmd), Labor and Delivery Dashboard. You can download the [quarto file](dashboard1.qmd).
  - The Labor and Delivery Dashboard provides a static yet comprehensive     summary of labor and delivery data, focusing on key metrics such as      maternal age, delivery methods, and infant weight. Using clear and       visually appealing charts, the dashboard presents data in a              structured manner, allowing for straightforward interpretation of        trends and patterns. For example, bar charts and tables are used to      display the distribution of delivery methods and infant outcomes.        This dashboard is an informative tool for understanding labor trends     and maternal-infant health outcomes, offering a concise overview of      the data for healthcare professionals and researchers. While not         interactive, its design ensures that the information is accessible       and easy to interpret.
- [Dashboard Example 2](dashboard2.qmd), Palmer Penguins.
You can download the [quota file](dashboard2.qmd).
  - The Palmer Penguins dashboard provides an engaging and interactive       exploration of data about three penguin species—Adélie, Chinstrap,       and Gentoo—collected from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. This     dashboard features clean and visually appealing charts, allowing         users to analyze key variables such as species, body mass, flipper       length, bill dimensions, and habitat islands. Using interactive          visualizations like scatter plots and bar charts, users can              dynamically filter the data by species or islands to uncover patterns     and trends in penguin traits. The dashboard showcases the versatility     of Quarto in creating interactive, data-driven applications that         enable users to explore relationships and gain insights from             real-world datasets intuitively.

## The Five Key Elements

Dr. Zhang will be happy if your dashboard clearly includes at least the
following five elements:

1.  A front page including a photo of you or of something relevant to
    you.
2.  Links to your social media presence, if any, and a way for people to
    get in touch with you via email.
3.  An About Me or Welcome section on your front page, which briefly
    describes what you’re doing now.
4.  Some information on your Education, Experiences, and/or Projects
5.  A way to download your CV

A blog is also an appealing way to connect your thoughts with the world,
and including non-professional stuff is OK, too, of course.
