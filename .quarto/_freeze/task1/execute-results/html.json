Completed Websites by Students in this year's class\n\n- [Atticus Kenny](https://atticus-kenny.github.io/atticuskenny/)\n- [Brooke Bhattacharya](https://bxb576.github.io/bxb576/)\n- [Dana Jian](https://dzjian1.github.io/)\n- [Isaac Zeng](https://www.isaaczz.com/)\n- [Jeff Lambe](https://jefflambe.quarto.pub/jeff-lambe/)\n- [JiaWei Yu](https://jiyu3048.github.io/jiyu3048/)\n- [Mahsa Sheikholeslamian](https://mahsa-sheikh.github.io/Mahsa-Sheikh/)\n- [Nihit Mehta](https://nmehta08.github.io/nmehta08/)\n- [Tatchaporn Ongphichetmetha](https://tatchaporn.github.io/tatchaporn/)\n- [Vedasree Machiraju](https://vmachira.github.io/)\n\n----\n\n## What is this?\n\nTask A requires you to build a professional website, or augment your\ncurrent one, if you already have one.\n\nThis is, we hope, a worthwhile opportunity for you to build your own\nprofessional website. Not only will this give you some additional\npractice coding and using R and R-adjacent tools like Quarto, it’s a\nlow-cost and potentially high-yield method to establish your\nprofessional presence online.\n\nTo complete this task successfully, you must submit a permanent URL from\nwhich Dr. Zhang has to be able to open your website and read its\ncontents.\n\n# Submitting your Website\n\nSubmit a link to your website to Dr. Zhang (lxz716@case.edu) and cc'ed TAs \tMonika Strah (mxs1667@case.edu) and Alex Olejko (awo14@case.edu) in an email with the subject\nline **My Website** by the deadline specified in the Course\nCalendar. In the body of your email, briefly tell me how you created the site (Quarto, or something else.)\n\n# Instructions and Guidance\n\nWe want you to build a professional looking website that will be useful\nto you. The content is (mostly) up to you, but it’s worth considering\nusing this opportunity to craft your online presence.\n\n## The Five Key Elements\n\nDr. Zhang will be happy if your site clearly includes at least the\nfollowing five elements:\n\n1.  A front page including a photo of you or of something relevant to\n    you.\n2.  Links to your social media presence, if any, and a way for people to\n    get in touch with you via email.\n3.  An About Me or Welcome section on your front page, which briefly\n    describes what you’re doing now.\n4.  Some information on your Education, Experiences, and/or Projects\n5.  A way to download your CV\n\nA blog is also an appealing way to connect your thoughts with the world,\nand including non-professional stuff is OK, too, of course.\n\n# Using Quarto to Build the Site\n\nHere are some resources that we think might be useful to you. If you\nfind others that are helpful, please share them with us.\n\n- Marvin Schmitt provides a full tutorial and template at [Create Your\n  Website with\n  Quarto](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/).\n  The template [shown\n  here](https://marvinschmitt.github.io/quarto-website-template/), for\n  example, gives you a great example of what I’m looking for. This is\n  the most common tool people who’ve completed this have mentioned to\n  me.\n- Quarto’s general guide to [Creating a\n  Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) may be helpful.\n- The Quarto website shows you how to create a blog website within R\n  Studio [in some detail\n  here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).\n- Sam Csik has useful thoughts on [Creating your personal website using\n  Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)\n- We found Drew Dimmery’s [Quarto for an Academic\n  Website](https://ddimmery.com/posts/quarto-website/) interesting and\n  useful.\n- [Chi Zhang’s\n  site](https://andreaczhang.github.io/qtwAcademic/articles/template_personal.html)\n  provides a nice template for a personal site.\n- The Quarto website shows you how to create a blog website within R\n  Studio [in some detail\n  here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).\n- Beatriz Milz’ [Creating a blog with Quarto in 10\n  Steps](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/)\n- Albert Rapp’s [The Ultimate Guide to Starting a Quarto\n  Blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html)\n- CrumpLab gives us [Blogging with Quarto: A 10 minute getting started\n  tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoKjBcuUP0s) (about 10\n  minutes)\n- Isabella Velásquez at RStudio has a YouTube video called [Building a\n  Blog with Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVcvXfRyfE0) (just\n  over an hour)\n- Thomas Mock shows you how to [Create & Publish a Quarto Blog on Quarto\n  Pub in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8qtcDyCRFA)\n- Joshua French has a playlist at YouTube of nine short videos that walk\n  you through [Creating Websites with Quarto and\n  Github](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkrJrLs7xfbXcEKhTCKRSr2VXH4yiBeXo)\n\n## Can I use something other than R / Quarto to build my site?\n\nYes, but you’ll receive less credit than a good Quarto site would\nreceive. So I don't suggest you to use something else.\n\nGood options to consider include [Owlstown](https://www.owlstown.com/),\nand [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), and each offers templates that would\nwork nicely.\n\nFollow whichever approach is best for you and you feel most comfortable\nwith. The key thing is to commit to making this a part of your life\ngoing forward, however you most effectively do that.\n\n## What if I already have an active website?\n\nIf it includes the five elements listed above, great! You should\ndefinitely submit it to me as soon as possible.\n\n## Should I spend a lot of money to have a fancy domain name?\n\nNo. There are many low-cost solutions if you want to register a domain\nand use it for this purpose. Google Domains can provide you with most\navailable domains for something like \\$1 per month. I wouldn’t go much\nabove that, and a free name is even better.\n\n\n## Will the TAs help me troubleshoot my website?\n\nIf they can, sure, but only after anyone else looking for 431 help has\nhad their problem settled. I do not guarantee that we can help fix your\nwebsite problems.\n\n## Grading Taks A\n\n- Task A is worth 45 points.\n- Students will receive all 45 points if ...\n    - their Task A  submission is on time, and\n    - their Task A site was built using Quarto, and\n    - their Task A site clearly includes [the five key elements listed above](#the-five-key-elements), and\n    - their Task A site has no unfixed typos or grammatical issues that Dr. Zhang notices in his review.\n- Students will receive a maximum of 40/45 points if their site was built using something other than Quarto, but otherwise meets these standards.\n\n\n<!-- ## Are there examples from past students? -->\n\n<!-- Yes.
