The deadline (for Project B Registration) is specified on the Course Calendar (it is in mid-November.)\n\n- [The form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2024) should open on November 1.

If you need to edit your submission, you can do so with the link included in that email.\n- If you are working with a partner, there will be an opportunity to indicate that on this form, and only one of you (you or your partner) should complete the whole thing, while the other person needs to only complete a few of the items, as you'll see.\n\nOnce your form is complete, Dr. Love will review your submission and get back to you to tell you whether your proposed approach is approved or not. If not, you'll have to edit your submission and [resubmit the form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2024).\n\n## What Do You Need To Do Before Filling Out the Form?\n\nFive things.\n\n1.
